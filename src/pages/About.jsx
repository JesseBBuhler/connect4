      <h4>What is this</h4>
      <p>
        It's Connect4! You place your coins into the columns and try to get four
        in a row before the other player. It's pretty fun!
      </p>
      <h4>Why I made this</h4>
      <p>
        I created this game to practice my react and css skills. As well as my
        ability to come up with an algorithm that could check to see if someone
        has won the game.
      </p>
